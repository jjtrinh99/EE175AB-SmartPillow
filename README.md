# EE175AB-SmartPillow

Smart Pillow project. Designed in EE175A/B at the University of California, Riverside, as my senior capstone project for undergraduate studies.

Completed from Fall 2020 - Winter 2021. The Smart Pillow monitors user snoring, pillow temperature, 
firmness setting of the pillow, and can monitor the user's heart rate.
